## Welcome to Richa Gupta's website

I am a final year Master's student at Columbia University. I am studying Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences (QMSS) majoring in Data Science. I took many interesting classes during my Masters and this website is an attempt to showcase some of the work I did.

I also interned as a Data Science for Social Good Fellow with eScience Institute at University of Washington. I worked on an immensely interesting and relevant project of Identifying Coronavirus Disinformation on online news articles. You can find more about the work ![here](https://uwescience.github.io/DSSG2020-Disinformation/) and the code we produced ![here](https://github.com/uwescience/DSSG2020-Disinformation).
